# Smart Streaming Platform

🔗 **Live demo:**  https://aravind7979.github.io/Smart-streaming-platform-/

A lightweight React-based frontend for a smart streaming platform — browse, search and explore media content. This repository contains the UI portion (React + JavaScript + HTML) and is an early-stage implementation of the app layout, home/explore/search pages and components.

> NOTE: This project is in active development. The README below is designed to get the app running locally and to give a clear roadmap for next steps.

## Tech stack
- Frontend: React (JavaScript)
- Markup: HTML
- Package manager: npm (or yarn)
- Recommended tools: ESLint, Prettier, GitHub Actions for CI

## Features (done / planned)
Done
- Initial React project structure and layout
- Navbar, sidebar and responsive layout
- Home feed UI with category chips
- Explore page (category browsing)
- Search page UI

Planned / suggested
- Video player (HLS/DASH) with adaptive streaming
- Backend APIs for media metadata, authentication and streaming
- Tests (unit and E2E), CI, and deployment setup
- Performance & accessibility improvements

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS recommended, e.g. 16.x or 18.x)
- npm (comes with Node) or yarn
- Git

## Getting started (local development)
1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/aravind7979/Smart-streaming-platform-.git
2. Enter the project folder
   cd Smart-streaming-platform-
4. Start the dev server
   
## Available scripts
Add or update these scripts in your package.json if they are not present:

- npm start — start the development server
- npm run build — create a production build
- npm test — run unit tests
- npm run lint — run ESLint
- npm run format — run Prettier

Example package.json scripts block:
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "react-scripts start",
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "test": "react-scripts test",
  "lint": "eslint src --ext .js,.jsx",
  "format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.{js,jsx,css,md}\""
}
```

## Environment variables
Create a `.env` file (gitignored) for any runtime configuration:
```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
REACT_APP_NODE_ENV=development
```
Add any API keys or host configuration here and document required variables.

## Project structure (suggested)
A typical React layout — adapt this to your repo:
```
/public
/src
  /components
  /pages
  /hooks
  /styles
  /assets
  App.js
  index.js
package.json
README.md
```

## Testing & quality
- Add unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library.
- Add E2E tests later with Cypress or Playwright.
- Add ESLint + Prettier for consistent code style.
- Add a GitHub Actions workflow to run lint and tests on PRs.

## Deployment
Common deployment targets:
- Vercel / Netlify — automatic builds from GitHub
- Static host on CDN after `npm run build`
- If you add a backend, deploy as separate service (Heroku, DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.)

Example: Deploy to Vercel
1. Connect GitHub repo
2. Use `npm run build` as the build command
3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard

## Roadmap
Short-term
- Wire up backend APIs for search and suggestions
- Integrate a video player component (HLS)
- Add README, LICENSE, and CONTRIBUTING.md

Mid-term
- Authentication (JWT / OAuth)
- Recommendations engine
- Analytics & monitoring (Sentry, Google Analytics)

Long-term
- Scalability: CDN, transcoding pipeline, adaptive bitrate streaming
- Mobile apps (React Native)
